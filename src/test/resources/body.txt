Problem Our computers are so excited about the upcoming Google I/O that they've started storing their ones as capital letter Is and their zeroes as capital letter Os! For example, the character A, which is 65 in ASCII, would normally be stored as the byte 01000001, but our computers are storing it as OIOOOOOI. Given a string of 8-character "bytes" consisting of Is and Os, can you translate it using ASCII? Every "byte" is guaranteed to translate to a printable character (a decimal value between 32 and 126, inclusive). Note that one of these characters (the one with decimal value 32) is a space. No translated message will begin or end with a space, but there may be internal space characters. Solving this problem Usually, Google Code Jam problems have 1 Small input and 1 Large input. This problem has only 1 Small input. Once you have solved the Small input, you have finished solving this problem. Input The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow; each consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer representing the number B of "bytes" in the string to be translated. The second line of each test case contains 8 * B characters, all of which are either I or O. Output For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the translated message. Limits Small dataset 1 ≤ T ≤ 100. 1 ≤ B ≤ 1000.
